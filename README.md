#  preprocessing the loan datasets  .
proplem : how to clean and preprocess the values (datasets) and prepare it to hand it to the data scientist
soution: change any text columns into  numbers and handling missing values using staticstics techniques (min , max , mean) 

## Dataset
 sample from larger data that belong to affiliate bank based on the USA

## key Features 
Data preprocessing : handling missing values using statisctics , ensure data consistensy , 
and converting all columns into dummy variables 

## Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/MM2462/Preprocessing_LoanData.git
cd Preprocessing_LoanData

1-  Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2-  Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the dataset:
jupyter notebook

## Usage
Run the preprocessing scripts in the src/ folder to clean and prepare the dataset.
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder for detailed analysis.
You can modify the dataset or analysis methods as needed based on your own objectives.
