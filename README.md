## This project focuses on the analysis of a loan dataset containing various details such as  loans status , loand amount , apartment ,and various features . 
The goal is to cleaning , and preprocessing  the data to help the data scientist to use it for creating credit risk model using machine learning algorithms
and estimate the probability of  the default

# Dataset
 sample from larger data that belong to affiliate bank based on the USA

# key Features 
Data preprocessing : handling missing values using statisctics , ensure dataconsistensy , 
and converting all columns into dummy variables 

# Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/MM2462/My_Project_1.git
cd My_Project_1

1-  Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2-  Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the dataset:
jupyter notebook

# Usage
Run the preprocessing scripts in the src/ folder to clean and prepare the dataset.
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder for detailed analysis.
You can modify the dataset or analysis methods as needed based on your own objectives.

# Future Improvements
Incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques for predicting loan default risk.
Expanding the dataset to include more features, such as customer income, credit score, or loan purpose.
Building a dashboard for dynamic data exploratio
